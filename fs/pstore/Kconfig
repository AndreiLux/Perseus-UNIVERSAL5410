config PSTORE
	bool "Persistent store support"
	default n
	help
	   This option enables generic access to platform level
	   persistent storage via "pstore" filesystem that can
	   be mounted as /dev/pstore.  Only useful if you have
	   a platform level driver that registers with pstore to
	   provide the data, so you probably should just go say "Y"
	   (or "M") to a platform specific persistent store driver
	   (e.g. ACPI_APEI on X86) which will select this for you.
	   If you don't have a platform persistent store driver,
	   say N.

config PSTORE_CONSOLE
	bool "Log kernel console messages"
	depends on PSTORE
	help
	  When the option is enabled, pstore will log all kernel
	  messages, even if no oops or panic happened.
