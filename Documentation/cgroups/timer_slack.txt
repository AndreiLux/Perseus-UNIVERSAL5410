Timer Slack Controller
======================

Overview
--------

Every task_struct has timer_slack_ns value. This value is used to round
up poll() and select() timeout values. This feature can be useful in
mobile environment where combined wakeups are desired.

Originally, prctl() was the only way to change timer slack value of
a process. So you was not able change timer slack value of another
process.

cgroup subsys "timer_slack" implements timer slack controller. It
provides a way to set minimal timer slack value for a group of tasks.
If a task belongs to a cgroup with minimal timer slack value higher than
task's value, cgroup's value will be applied.

Timer slack controller allows to implement setting timer slack value of
a process based on a policy. For example, you can create foreground and
background cgroups and move tasks between them based on system state.

By activating the dynamic management of the minimal timer slack value,
you can also use a different minimal timer slack value when the system
has been suspended.

User interface
--------------

To get timer slack controller functionality you need to enable it in
kernel configuration:

CONFIG_CGROUP_TIMER_SLACK=y

The controller provides two files:

# mount -t cgroup -o timer_slack none /sys/fs/cgroup
# ls /sys/fs/cgroup/timer_slack.*
/sys/fs/cgroup/timer_slack.effective_slack_ns
/sys/fs/cgroup/timer_slack.min_slack_ns

By default timer_slack.min_slack_ns is 0:

# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/timer_slack.min_slack_ns
0

You can set it to some value:

# echo 50000 > /sys/fs/cgroup/timer_slack.min_slack_ns
# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/timer_slack.min_slack_ns
50000

Tasks still can set task's value below 50000 using prctl(), but in this
case cgroup's value will be applied.

Timer slack controller supports hierarchical groups.

# mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/a
# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/a/timer_slack.min_slack_ns
50000
# echo 70000 > /sys/fs/cgroup/a/timer_slack.min_slack_ns
# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/a/timer_slack.min_slack_ns
70000

You can set any value you want, but effective value will the highest value
up by hierarchy. You can see effective timer slack value for the cgroup from
timer_slack.effective_slack_ns file:

# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/a/timer_slack.effective_slack_ns
70000
# echo 100000 > /sys/fs/cgroup/timer_slack.min_slack_ns
# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/a/timer_slack.min_slack_ns
70000
# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/a/timer_slack.effective_slack_ns
100000

Dynamic management of the minimal timer slack value
---------------------------------------------------

To also get the dynamic management of minimal timer slack value you need to
enable another option inside the kernel configuration:

CONFIG_CGROUP_DYNAMIC_TIMER_SLACK=y

This feature provides another file in addition to the above files:
/sys/fs/cgroup/timer_slack.min_slack_suspend_ns

By default timer_slack.min_slack_suspend_ns is 0:

# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/timer_slack.min_slack_suspend_ns
0

You can set it to some value that will be used when the system has been suspended:

# echo 100000 > /sys/fs/cgroup/timer_slack.min_slack_suspend_ns
# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/timer_slack.min_slack_suspend_ns
100000

Instead when the system is active it will use the timer_slack.min_slack_ns.
